# ringeveryone

a plugin for betterdiscord that rings everyone inside a group chat that you are in.

this plugin is broken at the moment, and doesn't work. i'll upload the updated plugin whenever it's finished. 

there is no eta, btw. right now, i'm trying to get all of discord's modules since they like to change them after some updates. smh.

there is a downfall with this plugin, though. whatever group chat you are in and want to ring, you must right click on it, then copy the channel id. once you do that, go to wherever the downloaded plugin is and right click and edit it and paste the channel id where it's supposed to go. (line 84 as of right now)
