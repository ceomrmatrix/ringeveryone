a plugin for betterdiscord that rings everyone inside a group chat that you are in.

this plugin is broken at the moment, and doesn't work. i'll upload the updated plugin whenever it's finished. 

there is no eta, btw. right now, i'm trying to get all of discord's modules since they like to change them after some updates. smh.
